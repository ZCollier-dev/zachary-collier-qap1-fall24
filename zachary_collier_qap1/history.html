        ASSIGNMENT: QAP1
        VEHICLE: Ford Bronco 4 Door Outer Banks SUV 2023
        
        END QUESTIONS
        1. I think the entire thing took around 20-30 hours, on and off? Maybe less.
        2. I used Noman's Powerpoints, W3Schools HTML and CSS, research on Stack Overflow, Penpot (open-source Figma alternative) for very basic layout visualization, Openverse for audio, Flickr for images.
        3. I did not need assistance from fellow classmates.
        4. I did not need assistance from instructors, though the lectures after the QAP document's posting really facilitated the process.
        5. I'd rate the process a 2/5 in difficulty. Nothing was too difficult, other than how finnicky CSS can be. The grid method significantly eased that difficulty. Otherwise, the hardest parts were brainstorming what to write about and combing through creative commons for suitable images. I definitely think I could use these same techniques in future projects.

        AUTHOR'S NOTES: Surprised at how interested I was during the research process. Not much of a car guy, but researching the Bronco gave me a newfound appreciation for vehicles.-->

          <h2>Preface</h2>
          <p>
            The Bronco line of SUVs has had a very strange history, filled with
            several attempts to break into the off-road market from 1965 to
            today. This generation leans heavily into its heritage from back in
            the day. So, what makes this line's history so fascinating?
          </p>
          <h2>1965-1977</h2>
          <p>
            The first generation of Broncos is notable not only for being...
            well... the first, but also the longest-running Bronco generation to
            date. Time will tell if that holds true in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Considered an indirect successor to WWII's Ford GPW, the Bronco was
            intended as a compliment to the new Ford Mustangs. Where the
            Mustangs are expensive sports cars, the Bronco was intended as a
            youth-friendly off-roader.
          </p>
          <p>At the time, the Bronco offered up three body styles:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The Wagon - a 2-door vehicle with a removable hard top,</li>
            <li>
              The Roadster - a roofless vehicle with inserts instead of doors,
              and
            </li>
            <li>
              As a Sports Utility Pickup, or half-cab - replacing the rear bench
              seat for a mini pickup bed.
            </li>
          </ul>

            The Roadster lasted for 3 years, until 1968. The half-cab remained
            in production until 1973, leaving the Wagon as the sole body style
            up until the first generation's end in 1977.

            writes this in reference to the production quantity of the
            first-generation Bronco:
            <q
              >A total of 225,585 first-generation Broncos were built, according
              to the best available figures, made up of 203,544 wagons, 17,262
              sports utility pickups, and 5,000 roadsters.</q

          <h2>1978-1979</h2>
          <p>
            The gas crisis of 1973 caused manufacturers to cut costs wherever
            they could. Were it not for this, the Bronco of this generation may
            have been a 1974 or 1975 model instead. But alas, due to
            manufacturing difficulties and upcoming scheduled 1978 refresh of
            the Shrothorn project, the Bronco was the vehicle to get the
            facelift to save on tooling costs, featuring 2 doors only. The
            4-door had to be cut short due to the risk.

            Unlike its predecessors and progeny, which sported options for
            multiple engine sizes, the second generation only offered a
            <abbr title="Shorthand for an 8-cylinder engine.">V-8</abbr>
            engine. Despite its size, however, it underperformed in terms of
            horsepower.

          <p>
            One may suspect nothing to be changed from 2nd to 3rd generation
            Brocos, but under the hood, many changes were made to make the
            Bronco lighter. They also swapped the solid front axle for an
            Independent Front Suspension (IFS) called the Twin Traction Beam,
            making Ford the only American manufacturer to offer an IFS 4x4 at
            that time.

            The engine also got an upgrade, now able to choose a
            <abbr title="Shorthand for a 6-cylinder engine.">V-6</abbr> option
            once more. The V-8 engine also got a power bump in 1982, and another
            significant bump with a 210 hp V-8 engine alongside a new 190 hp
            electric fuel injection V-8 engine.

            The fourth generation Broncos were more focused on minor tweaks as
            opposed to full-on under-the-hood overhauls. Though, that does not
            mean there were no improvements, far from it. The introduction of an
            electric shift 4-wheel drive system into the vehicle, allowing the
            Bronco to have even better driving capabilities.

            External restyling to make the Bronko look more modern and
            aerodynamic. The V-6 engine also recieved a power boost, jumping to
            150 hp from 125 hp. Towing capacity hit a maximum of 7700 lbs during
            this generation - a value which it hovered at during the next
            generation as well.

          <p>
            In this generation's final year, 2500 Silver Anniversary vehicles
            were manufactured, painted a Currant Red, a plush, one-off leather
            interior in silver gray with captain's chairs. A sight to behold,
            I'm sure, and certainly the fourth generation's highlight.

            With its upgrades and new look, just under 200,000 Broncos were
            manufactured during this time.

            The fifth generation Broncos were the final generation for a long,
            long time. Airbags were introduced and made standard in the 1994
            models, and a significant cosmetic refresh hoped to revitalize the
            Bronco. A Nite version of the Bronco XLT was added, featuring a
            blacked-out appearance and special badging. Very few were produced.

          <p>
            However, there was a Bronco killer in Ford's lineup - the 4-door
            Ford Explorer. Up until 1996, the Bronco's towing capacity allowed
            it to stick around. Eventually, the 1997 Expedition surpassed the
            capabilities of the Bronco in both towing capacity and fuel
            efficiency. With additional production ties to the mythical Ford
            F-150, the Bronco was laid to rest...

            Inspired by the retro aesthatic of Broncos past, the Bronco now has
            modern sensibilities, including now coming as a 4-door option in
            conjunction with the classic 2-door. Its looks are highly
            distinctive as a result of the retro-modern combo.
          </p>
          <p>
            As with many vehicles nowadays, the new Broncos come with
            infotainment screens, between 8 and 12 inches. The Broncos also have
            removable doors and roofs, and much more powerful and efficient
            engine options compared to its predecessors. It also has Go Over Any
            Terrain modes, or GOAT modes. As the name implies, these modes allow
            the Bronco to adapt to any terrain at the press of a button. Makes
            sense, given goats' surprising ability to climb cliff faces in some
            instances.
          </p>
          <p>
            But all this begs the question: why now? Interestingly, it landed
            smack-dab in the middle of the SUV craze and a rising interest in
            off-roading ventures. It's taking on the Jeep Wrangler, a line of
            SUVs which coasted along competitor free for a while as one of the
            top dogs of off-road vehicles, while also being the only SUV until
            the Bronco to have removable doors and roof.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the Ford Bronco making a comeback, time will tell if the modern
            Bronco will continue to flourish, or if the rising cost of living
            all around will get the better of it in the end.
