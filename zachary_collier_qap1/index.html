        ASSIGNMENT: QAP1
        VEHICLE: Ford Bronco 4 Door Outer Banks SUV 2023
        
        END QUESTIONS
        1. I think the entire thing took around 20-30 hours, on and off? Maybe less.
        2. I used Noman's Powerpoints, W3Schools HTML and CSS, research on Stack Overflow, Penpot (open-source Figma alternative) for very basic layout visualization, Openverse for audio, Flickr for images.
        3. I did not need assistance from fellow classmates.
        4. I did not need assistance from instructors, though the lectures after the QAP document's posting really facilitated the process.
        5. I'd rate the process a 2/5 in difficulty. Nothing was too difficult, other than how finnicky CSS can be. The grid method significantly eased that difficulty. Otherwise, the hardest parts were brainstorming what to write about and combing through creative commons for suitable images. I definitely think I could use these same techniques in future projects.

        AUTHOR'S NOTES: Surprised at how interested I was during the research process. Not much of a car guy, but researching the Bronco gave me a newfound appreciation for vehicles.-->

          <h2>Brief Overview</h2>
          <p>
            The Ford Bronco 4 Door Outer Banks
            <abbr title="Sport Utility Vehicle">SUV</abbr> 2023 is a 4-wheel
            drive <abbr title="Sport Utility Vehicle">SUV</abbr> released in
            Summer 2022, following up its sixth-generation predecessors
            initially conceptualized in Summer 2020. The Bronco line is a
            response to the Jeep Wrangler line, competing in the off-road
            market.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Bronco, however, failed to gain traction against Jeep during its
            prior 5 generations. This generation sports a wide variety of
            versions, both 2 door and 4 door, with some advanced, including,
            from least to most expensive:

          <p>
            The Bronco Outer Banks specifically benefits from solid handling and
            off-road capabilities. However, the vehicle falls victim to several
            design flaws affecting reliability on the road, excessive fuel
            consumption and high prices in an era where money is a notable issue
            for many.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Outer Banks 4-Door SUV costs approximately $59,540 Canadian, as
            reported by <cite>driving.ca</cite>. Prices may be higher or lower
            depending on your local dealer.
